            "  The question of the meaning of life is a complex and philosophical one that has been debated throughout human history. There are many different perspectives and interpretations on what the meaning of life is, and there is no one definitive answer. However, here are some possible ways to approach this question:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Religious or spiritual perspective: Many people believe that the meaning of life is to fulfill a divine or spiritual purpose. According to this view, life has a higher purpose that is connected to a deity or a higher power. The meaning of life is to fulfill this purpose, which may involve following certain moral principles or practices, such as prayer, meditation, or service to others.\n",
            "2. Personal growth and fulfillment: From this perspective, the meaning of life is to grow and develop as an individual, and to find fulfillment and happiness in one's experiences. This may involve pursuing one's passions and interests, building meaningful relationships, and achieving personal goals.\n",
            "3. Social or cultural perspective: From this view, the meaning of life is tied to one's social or cultural context. For example, some cultures place a strong emphasis on family and community, while others prioritize individualism and personal freedom. The meaning of life may be found in contributing to the greater good of one's society or community.\n",
            "4. Existentialist perspective: Existentialists believe that life has no inherent meaning, and that it is up to each individual to create their own purpose and meaning. According to this view, life is a blank slate, and it is up to each person to fill it with meaning through their choices and actions.\n",
            "5. Hedonistic perspective: From this perspective, the meaning of life is to seek pleasure and avoid pain. According to this view, life is about maximizing one's enjoyment and minimizing one's suffering, and finding ways to do so in a way that is ethical and responsible.\n",
            "6. Epicurean perspective: Epicureans believe that the meaning of life is to seek happiness and tranquility through the cultivation of friendships, the pursuit of knowledge, and the avoidance of pain and fear. According to this view, life is about living in the present moment and finding joy in the simple things.\n",
            "7. Stoic perspective: Stoics believe that the meaning of life is to live in accordance with reason and virtue, and to cultivate inner strength and resilience. According to this view, life is about accepting the things that are outside of one's control, and focusing on what one can control, such as one's thoughts and actions.\n",
            "8. Humanistic perspective: From this perspective, the meaning of life is to fulfill one's potential as a human being, and to make the most of one's time on earth. According to this view, life is about developing one's talents and abilities, and using them to make a positive impact on the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "These are just a few of the many possible perspectives on the meaning of life. Ultimately, the answer to this question may be different for each person, and may depend on their individual experiences, beliefs, and values.\n"

        "\n",
        "Here are some different ways to build applications based on LLMs, in increasing order of cost/complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompting. Giving a pretrained LLM instructions lets you build a prototype in minutes or hours without a training set. Earlier this year, I saw a lot of people start experimenting with prompting, and that momentum continues unabated. Several of our short courses teach best practices for this approach.\n",
        "One-shot or few-shot prompting. In addition to a prompt, giving the LLM a handful of examples of how to carry out a task — the input and the desired output — sometimes yields better results.\n",
        "Fine-tuning. An LLM that has been pretrained on a lot of text can be fine-tuned to your task by training it further on a small dataset of your own. The tools for fine-tuning are maturing, making it accessible to more developers.\n",
        "Pretraining. Pretraining your own LLM from scratch takes a lot of resources, so very few teams do it. In addition to general-purpose models pretrained on diverse topics, this approach has led to specialized models like BloombergGPT, which knows about finance, and Med-PaLM 2, which is focused on medicine.\n",
        "For most teams, I recommend starting with prompting, since that allows you to get an application working quickly. If you’re unsatisfied with the quality of the output, ease into the more complex techniques gradually. Start one-shot or few-shot prompting with a handful of examples. If that doesn’t work well enough, perhaps use RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to further improve prompts with key information the LLM needs to generate high-quality outputs. If that still doesn’t deliver the performance you want, then try fine-tuning — but this represents a significantly greater level of complexity and may require hundreds or thousands more examples. To gain an in-depth understanding of these options, I highly recommend the course Generative AI with Large Language Models, created by AWS and DeepLearning.AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Fun fact: A member of the DeepLearning.AI team has been trying to fine-tune Llama-2-7B to sound like me. I wonder if my job is at risk? 😜)\n",
        "\n",
        "Additional complexity arises if you want to move to fine-tuning after prompting a proprietary model, such as GPT-4, that’s not available for fine-tuning. Is fine-tuning a much smaller model likely to yield superior results than prompting a larger, more capable model? The answer often depends on your application. If your goal is to change the style of an LLM’s output, then fine-tuning a smaller model can work well. However, if your application has been prompting GPT-4 to perform complex reasoning — in which GPT-4 surpasses current open models — it can be difficult to fine-tune a smaller model to deliver superior results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond choosing a development approach, it’s also necessary to choose a specific model. Smaller models require less processing power and work well for many applications, but larger models tend to have more knowledge about the world and better reasoning ability. I’ll talk about how to make this choice in a future letter.\n",

Spanish player Aitana Bonmatí was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball, whilst Bonmatí's teammate Salma Paralluelo was awarded the Young Player Award. England goalkeeper Mary Earps won the Golden Glove, awarded to the best-performing goalkeeper of the tournament.\n",
